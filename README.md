# Drawing Application  

## üìñ Introduction  

**Drawing Application** is a versatile Java desktop application developed using **JFrame** and **Swing**. It provides an interactive platform to draw, customize, and manipulate shapes while integrating features like color selection, game tasks, and undo/redo functionality. Additionally, it supports **database integration** for data persistence, making it both a practical tool and a great learning project.

## ‚ú® Key Features  

- **Shape Drawing**:  
  Draw, customize, and manipulate shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles) on a canvas.  

- **Color Picker**:  
  Dynamically select colors for shapes or UI elements.  

- **Undo/Redo**:  
  Seamlessly reverse or reapply recent actions for flexibility in design.  

- **Game Task**:  
  Engage with a simple, fun game task built into the application.  

- **Database Integration**:  
  Store and retrieve user data or designs using a relational database (SQLite/MySQL).  

- **Customizable UI**:  
  An interactive and visually appealing user interface enhanced with colors and modern design elements.
